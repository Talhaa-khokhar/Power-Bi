# Titanic Dataset Exploration Using Power BI

This Power BI project explores the Titanic dataset to analyze various factors affecting the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to gain insights into the Titanic dataset using Power BI.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains various attributes of passengers on the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.

## Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Perform data transformations as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the distribution of passengers by age, gender, ticket class, and other attributes.
   - Explore the survival rate based on different factors.
   - Visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots to visualize the data effectively.
   - Generate insights into the factors affecting passenger survival.

4. **Insights:**
   - Identify factors that contributed to the survival of passengers.
   - Explore relationships between different attributes and survival rates.
   - Provide actionable insights for decision-making.
